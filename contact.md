## Contact Form

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to drop me a message here. I’m always excited to take on fun new projects and commissions. Response times are slow right now due to high work load, but I ususally email back within 3-5 business days.

### What to include in your message

**General messages**  
Tell me a bit about yourself and what’s prompting you to reach out.

**Commission inquiries**
- What is your vision for the project?
- What is your budget for the completed work?
- What is your ideal timeframe for delivery?
