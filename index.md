## Background

​In my former life, I was a **software developer**. I graduated from Northeastern University, in Boston, with a BS in Computer Science in 2003. After college I had a very successful 6+ year career as a programmer in the video-game industry. Sadly, my work in the intangible world of software was not fulfilling for me or sustainable as a life long career path.

In 2009, I took a leap of faith and quit my programming gig to become a traditional artist and work in my dream job as a stop-motion puppet fabricator. Rather than returning to college I sought out classes around LA and created my own curriculum between local schools and workshops. Through hard work, persistence, and my "don't be a dick" mantra, I realized my dreams and found my way into paid full-time work in stop-motion. Once inside, I have continued to build my portfolio of skills and work in various departments, including puppet and scenic painting, puppet fabrication, rapid prototyping (3D print shop), set dressing, and prop fabrication.

I am grateful for all of the opportunities I have been given, and the incredible artists that I work with across many imaginative studios here in Los Angeles.​

## My Mission

My mission is to bring the **open-source mentality of software development** into the creative world and **reduce gatekeeping**.

I aim to empower others to pursue their creative dreams, fulfill their artistic potential, and live well-rounded lives. I firmly believe that **we all benefit when everyone has equitable access to resources and opportunities**, and I freely share what I’ve learned with anyone who wants to listen.
