## Hey there!

My name is **Rachel** (she/they). I’m a **maker, artist, and stop-motion fabricator** based in Los Angeles, CA, USA.

I’m a **lead painter and puppet fabricator** with **10+ years of professional experience** in stop-motion and live-action animation. My work focuses on traditional painting, sculpting, and 3D modeling for rapid prototyping, with end-to-end technical skills to bring ideas from initial sketches into reality.
- Navigating important design decisions  
- Budgeting and guidance for development cost savings  
- Digital modeling and 3D printing (rapid prototyping)  
- Molding and casting for mass production  
- Armature design and fabrication

## Background

In a former life, I was a **software developer**. I graduated from Northeastern University in Boston with a **BS in Computer Science (2003)** and spent over **six years** working as a programmer in the video game industry.

While successful, working in the intangible world of software was not fulfilling or sustainable for me long-term.

In 2009, knowing I wanted to become a traditional artist and work in stop-motion animation, I took a leap of faith and left my programming career. Instead of returning to college, I built my own curriculum through local schools and workshops around Los Angeles.

Through hard work, persistence, and my personal mantra of *“don’t be a dick,”* I realized my dream of working professionally in stop-motion animation.

Since then, I’ve continued to expand my skill set across multiple departments, including:
- Puppet and scenic painting  
- Puppet fabrication  
- Rapid prototyping (3D print shops)  
- Set dressing  
- Prop fabrication  

I’m deeply grateful for the opportunities I’ve been given and for the incredible artists I get to work alongside across many imaginative studios in Los Angeles.

## My Mission

My mission is to bring the **open-source mentality of software development** into the creative world and **reduce gatekeeping**.

I aim to empower others to pursue their creative dreams, fulfill their artistic potential, and live well-rounded lives. I firmly believe that **we all benefit when everyone has equitable access to resources and opportunities**, and I freely share what I’ve learned with anyone who wants to listen.
